# Evan Anonymous Credentials

This is a proof of concept library to determine the possibilities of the [Hyperledger Ursa library](https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa) regarding ZKPs, and
how it suits our requirements and needs.
It simulates a workflow of issuing and proving a zero-knowledge verifiable credential.

The library is wasm-compatible.
